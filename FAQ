Q. Why the fsck does a freaking music player consume so much CPU ?
A. Use the HW device directly in ALSA (hw:0,0). The 'default' device
   is dmix which is setup with a samplerate of 48Khz while most tracks
   are in 44.1Khz samplerate. Resampling is cpu intensive. Using the HW
   device, bypassing the dmix plugin is the current workaround.
   Of course, you lose the advantages of dmix in the process.
